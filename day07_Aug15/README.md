### Making an interferogram

Follow these instructions: https://asf.alaska.edu/how-to/data-recipes/create-an-interferogram-using-esas-sentinel-1-toolbox/

These instructions contain a link to example data for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake in Japan. If you want to process data from the Ridgecrest earthquake instead, download them from the Day 7 folder here: https://unmm-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eol_unm_edu/Eow7Z0HhfThKmkPtX8kHF6YBR3QvPLdyrt0OpUqBqr27kg?e=SNnBEZ

You will want to use Google Earth to view the final results. If you don't have that, you can download it here: https://earth.google.com/intl/earth/download/ge/agree.html
